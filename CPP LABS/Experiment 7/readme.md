Aim: Write a C++ program using this pointer.

Step by Step procedure for the experiment:

Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream)

Step 2 - Create a class (Employee) with the following class members as public members and name,id and salary as data members.

Step 3 - Creat display() as member function

Step 4 - Call a parameterised constructor with local variable is same as a member's name.

Step 5 - Inside the parameterised constructor this pointer is used to retrieve the object's hidden by the local variables name,id,salary.

Step 6 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 7 - Creating the main() method.

Step 8 - Creating two objects of Employee e1 and e2 along with parameters.

Step 9 - Call the member function display().

Step 10 - return 0 to exit from the program execution.
