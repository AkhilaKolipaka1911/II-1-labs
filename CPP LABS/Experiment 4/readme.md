Aim: Write a c++ program to declare struct.Intialise and display contents of member variables.

Step by Step Procedure of the Experiment:

Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream.h and conio.h).

Step 2 - Create a structure (Person) with the following member variables. name, age, and intake as data members.

Step 3 - Create a main() method.

Step 4 - Create a variable of the above structure inside the main() method.

Step 5 - Then, read data into member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.

Step 6 - Finally, display data of member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.

Step 7 - return 0 to exit form the program execution
