Aim: Program to demostrate Constructor and Destructor.

Step by Step Procedure of the experiment Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2 - Create a class Numbers with x, y as data members.

Step 3 - Creat display() as member function.

Step 4 - Initialize variables x and y using parameterized constructor.

Step 5 - Declare a destructor within the class.

Step 6 - Define the function display() outside the class using scope resolution operator.

Step 7 - In the main() function, call the constructor and display() function.

Step 8 - return 0 to exit from the program execution.
