Aim: Write a C++ program to use scope resolution operator.Display the various values of the same variable declared at different scope levels.

Step by Step procedure of experiment:

Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream.h).

Step 2 - Create a base class A1 (Grand_parent) with the following class members as public members.

Step 3 - Creat a1 as data member and display1() as member function.

Step 4 - Initialise the value of a1 by using default constructor and implement display1() function.

Step 5 - Create a class A2 (parent) derived from Grand_parent with the following class members as public members. a2 as data member and display2() as member function.

Step 6 - Initialise the value of a2 by using default constructor and implement display2() function.

Step 7 - Create a class A3 (child) derived from parent with the following class members as public members.

Step 8 -Creat a3 as data member, display3(), max() as member functions.

Step 9 - Define the function max() outside the class using scope resolution operator.

Step 10 - Initialise the value of i with 100 and in main initialise i with 200.

Step 11 - Declare the child class object obj and call the functions max() and display3().

Step 12 - Obtain different values of i using the scope resolution operator.

Step 13 - return 0 to exit the program.
